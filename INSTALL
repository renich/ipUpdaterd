# INSTALL
#
# This was tested on Fedora 14 x86_64. It might work on any SysV and LSB
# compilant distro... I think...

# Option 1:
# Run the "install" script included in the package.
su -c ./install

# Option 2:
# Install manually

# Become root
su -

# Uncompress
tar -xjf ipUpdater.tar.bz2

# Go into the directory
cd ipUpdater

# Make sure the install script is executable
chmod u+x ./install

# Execute the install
./install

# Go to the conf file
cd /usr/local/etc

# Edit it
vim ipUpdaterd.conf

# Enter your username

# Open another terminal and generate a base64 hash of your password (just to keep it encoded to other users eyes)
echo "my_super_password" | base64

# Copy that into the conf file

# If you don't use a ppp connection, leave "myip" empty, if you do, uncomment the first myip and delete the otherone

# Start the service
service ipUpdaterd start

# Activate the service on boot
chkconfig ipUpdaterd on
