ipUpdaterd
==========

This, is a simple dynamic IP updater client; compatible with SystemD. 

It's pre-configured for DNSExit but it's easy to add support for more Dynamic IP DNS providers.

It's a bash script and it works as a daemon. I've tested it on Fedora 20 and it works fine.

Anyway, check it out and feel free to contribute!
